# ReClaim – A Street Reuse and Community Clean-Up Website

## Project Overview

ReClaim is a simple community website that helps people share unwanted items left on the street and keep neighborhoods clean.  
Residents can take a photo and upload it so others can see and collect useful items.  
If no one takes the items after a few days, they appear in a City Clean-Up view so city workers or volunteers can see the location and remove them.  

This reduces waste and helps streets stay safe and tidy.

## Site Narrative

### Title  
ReClaim – A Street Reuse and Community Clean-Up Website  

### Description  

ReClaim is a simple community website that helps people share unwanted items left on the street and keep neighborhoods clean. Residents can take a photo and upload it so others can see and collect useful items. If no one takes the items after a few days, they appear in a City Clean-Up view so city workers or volunteers can see the location and remove them. This reduces waste and helps streets stay safe and tidy.  

### Target Audience  

- City residents, age 20–60, living in urban or suburban areas.  
- People who want to give away items instead of throwing them away.  
- People who like to reuse or collect free items.  
- City cleaning teams and community volunteers.  

### Purpose  

The website encourages people to reuse old furniture, appliances, and other items that are still usable.  
It also helps city services respond faster when items stay on the street for too long or become unsafe.  
The goal is to build cleaner, greener, and more caring communities.  

### Main Features  

1. **Home Page**  
   - Shows a short message about the ReClaim idea.  
   - Highlights three main actions: upload items, share and reuse items, and support clean-up.  

2. **Upload Items**  
   - Users can take a photo and add details such as item type, condition, and location.  
   - Users can publish the item so neighbors can see it and take it.  

3. **City Clean-Up Dashboard**  
   - A simple table view for city teams and volunteers.  
   - Lists items that are expiring, overdue, or hazardous.  
   - Allows them to remove items and mark them as cleaned.  

4. **Resource Page**  
   - Offers links to websites for reuse, donation, recycling, and safe disposal of hazardous waste.  

5. **About Page**  
   - Explains the mission of ReClaim and how the website works.  
   - Describes who it is for.  
   - Lists basic safety and community guidelines.  

### Design  

The website uses simple colors and clear layout:  

- Green as the main color for navigation and reuse/environment themes.  
- Orange as an accent color for important headings and buttons.  
- Blue for helpful links or extra information.  
- White and light gray backgrounds for a clean look.  
- Dark text for strong contrast and easy reading.  
- Large headings and clear buttons to help users focus on key actions like **“Upload an Item”** and **“Mark Cleaned.”**  

### Call-to-Action Statement 

Residents should take photos and share their unwanted items on ReClaim because this helps reduce waste, supports neighbors who need items, and keeps the streets clean and safe.
